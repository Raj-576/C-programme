1. **You**: Check the following code for bugs and provide repair suggestions: 
```c
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int num,n;
    printf("Enter the number :");
    scanf("%d",&num);
    printf("Enter the number of times that you want to calculate :");
    scanf("%d",&n);
    printf("table of %d\n",num);
    for(int i = 1;i<=n;i++);
    {
        printf("%d x %d = %d\n",num,i,num*i);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

    }
    return 0;
}
```
3. **ChatGPT**: The issue in the code is a semicolon at the end of the for loop statement, which unintentionally terminates the loop. Here's the corrected code:

```c
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int num, n;
    printf("Enter the number: ");
    scanf("%d", &num);
    printf("Enter the number of times that you want to calculate: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);
    printf("Table of %d\n", num);
    for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
    {
        printf("%d x %d = %d\n", num, i, num * i);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

In the corrected code:
1. Removed the semicolon after the for loop condition to prevent unintentional loop termination.
2. Made sure there are spaces after the colons in the `printf` statements for better readability.
3. Corrected the formatting and indentation for better code readability.
